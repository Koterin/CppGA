AI-based experimental data approximation curve selection.

This project lets you set some experimental data (in a form of two-dimensional graph) and select an approximation curve in a symbolic form - for example, for something like that

![ExpData](images/expData.jpg)

The output formula would be v(t)=((((t+0.2)^(8.1)*t+t)^(4.28)*t+t)^2+1.01)^(-0.68) with the final accuracy of 90%
